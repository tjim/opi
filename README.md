# Open Parser Initiative

The Open Parser Initiative (OPI) seeks to encourage the development of parsing technology by collecting parsing challenges and open source solutions to the challenges.

We are particularly interested in broadening the scope of existing parsing tools, and making it possible to compare different parsing tools.

We pose three kinds of challenges.

* *Core* challenges are those we hope that all parsing tools will try to solve.
* *Mini* challenges are smaller problems that isolate technical hurdles that need to be solved in the core challenges.
* *Optional* challenges are interesting real-world parsing problems.

We publish solutions to these challenges written in different parsing tools.  The solutions should be

* open source, and
* should solve at least the mini and core challenges.

## Contributions

We are interested in receiving both parsing challenges and solutions.  All contributions must be open source.  We are using a public repository on GitHub, so we must comply with [their terms of service](http://help.github.com/terms/); in particular, in order for us to use your contribution we must satisfy the copyright conditions in section F.

Domain names used in inputs should be chosen from those reserved for documentation (see [RFC 2606](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606)).  They must end in example.com, example.net, or example.org.

IP addresses used in inputs should be chosen from those reserved for documentation (see [RFC 5737](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)).

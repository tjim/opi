# python-3.1

Parse the input according to the [Python 3.1 specification](http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.3/reference/index.html).

Output OK if the input parses correctly, and FAIL otherwise.

## Notes

The Python grammar is a context-free LR(1) grammar over tokens.

The lexical specification is unusual in handling encoding specifications and Python's indentation rules.

There are significant syntactic differences between the Python 2.x and 3.x series.
